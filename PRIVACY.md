# Privacy Policy

**LeetCode Friends** is a Chrome extension that enhances your experience on [leetcode.com](https://leetcode.com) by letting you view your friends’ LeetCode activity directly from the site.

## What We Collect

- The extension reads your **LeetCode username** from the site to identify your profile.
- It sends your username to our backend (`https://leetcodefriends.online`) to retrieve your friends list and leaderboard data.

## What We Don’t Collect

- We **do not collect**, store, or access your LeetCode login credentials, passwords, or private problem history.
- We do not access or track your browsing activity outside of LeetCode.
- We do not use cookies, trackers, or analytics scripts.

## Data Usage

- The username and friend-related data is used **only** to provide the leaderboard and friend request features within the extension.
- No personal data is shared with third parties.

## Security

- All requests to our backend are encrypted via HTTPS.
- We follow the principle of least privilege and request only necessary permissions in the extension manifest.
